# AnimalGuessingGame

This idea comes from my kids (5 and 8) who like to play the "Animal Game" with an Amazon Echo.  There is also a [reddit programming challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/34asls/20150429_challenge_212_intermediate_animal_guess/).  I would like to make this into a chat or twitter bot or web application at some point and also improve its sophistication / features.  Any help appreciated!
